### USE GUIDE:

This project use C language to relize FFT algorithm, and then calculate 
cross-correlation by FFT. Use FFT to calculate cross-correlation will 
improve the performance from O(N^2) to O(n*log(n))

Fllow steps to use this projects:

1. make
2. make run
3. open matlab and run plot_result.m
